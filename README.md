# ReniBot
An AIML bot implemented in C# and .NET Core.  This bot can read in Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) files that will 
determine responses to chat requests from a user.  This is based on the 1.0 specification with future versions supporting 2.1.  
You can find the [specifications here](https://github.com/AIML-Foundation) and documentation on AIML at the [AIML Foundation](http://www.aiml.foundation/).
